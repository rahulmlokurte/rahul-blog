Our goal is to build a simple implementation of image recognition. To achieve this, we will use the Vision Framework, which was introduced in iOS 11 to apply computer vision algorithms to perform a variety of tasks on input images and video.

Our implementation will use the Vision APIs to pre-process the input image. We will, however, need a trained machine learning model to identify the image. So, we will also use the Core ML framework to integrate models that make predictions of what the input image.
