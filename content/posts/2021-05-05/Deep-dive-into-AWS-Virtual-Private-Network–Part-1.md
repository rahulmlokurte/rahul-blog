title: "Deep dive into AWS Virtual Private Network – Part 1"
excerpt: "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service provided by Amazon which is used to privately create a virtual network within the AWS. The network will be completely controlled by us. We can define our own IP addresses, subnets, route tables, NAT gateway. With Amazon VPC, we can create an public subnet exposed to the internet and also, we can create an private subnet with no internet access."

Our goal is to build a simple implementation of image recognition. To achieve this, we will use the Vision Framework, which was introduced in iOS 11 to apply computer vision algorithms to perform a variety of tasks on input images and video.

Our implementation will use the Vision APIs to pre-process the input image. We will, however, need a trained machine learning model to identify the image. So, we will also use the Core ML framework to integrate models that make predictions of what the input image.
